Movie-Ratings
=============

Movie Ratings is used to build a database of movie ratings from multiple sources to determine which rating sites best match your opinions of a film. Included is an extensible "Adapter" system. Each adapter is responsible for fetching reviews from a specific source. There are currently adapters for Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, and Metacritic but more can be added.
